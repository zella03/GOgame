University project for the Basics of computer programming course conducted during the first semester. The aim of the project was to design and implement game GO in C/C++ language. 

Game rules:
- Starting with black, each player takes turns to place a single stone on the board.
- When a stone is played so that it causes a group of opposing stones to have no liberties, that group is captured.
- A player cannot play a stone to a location such that a previous position is repeated.

The project is accessible from the Projectcpp22.sln file level. This is the project file created in the Visual Studio programme.
